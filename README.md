## 🔐 Security & Rules

- 🔄 **Cascade Deletion**: When a study group is deleted, all related study sessions are automatically removed from the database.  
- 🔒 **Protected Routes**: Both frontend routes and backend controllers are secured with JWT authentication.
- 👤 **Ownership Verification**: Users can only modify or delete content that they created, ensuring proper access control.

---

## 🧱 System Architecture

The application follows a classic **client-server architecture**. The React frontend communicates with the Node.js/Express backend via a **RESTful API**, secured using **JWT authentication**.

---

## 🔗 Database Schema & Relationships

### Schema

- **User**: name, email, password, enrolled courses
- **Course**: name, code, description
- **StudyGroup**: name, course reference, members, creator
- **StudySession**: topic, date/time, duration, group reference, creator

Study Flux uses a relational approach within MongoDB to handle the complex dependencies between users, courses, and collaborative sessions.

### Logic Highlights

- 🔁 **User ↔ Course** – Many-to-Many relationship to support course enrollment.  
- 📘 **Course ↔ Study Group** – One-to-Many relationship where each course can have multiple study groups.  
- 📅 **Study Group ↔ Study Session** – One-to-Many relationship with cascade delete logic for automatic cleanup.  
- 👤 **Ownership Rules** – Both `StudyGroup` and `StudySession` store a `creator` field to enforce permission-based actions.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- 🔔 **Session Reminders & Notifications**  
- 💬 **Group Chat**  
- ⭐ **Course & Study Group Ratings**  
- 📊 **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**
